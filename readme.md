# BeatCraft
> Lets BeatBlock's!

### Go MaaD: Minecraft as a DAW
- Sequencers (wip)
- Sends (wip)
- Custom samples (todo)

### Recipes
- sequencer: note blocks surrounding a beat
- repeater: note blocks surrounding an enderpearl
- speaker: note blocks surrounding an empty bucket

### TODO
- on adding beats to graph, show connected paths using particle effects
- spawn particles on beats indicating type of block
- rotate sends to change their direction and make texture directional
- fix recipe deduction glitch
- add delay based on the type of block that is put in the line
- change pitch based on the type of block that is put in the line (up or down)
- right click sequencer to change speed, indicate using color/pitch/something
- create special sequencers that only play on air and only delays through blocks
