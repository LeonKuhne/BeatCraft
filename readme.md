# BeatCraft
> Lets BeatBlock's!

### Go MaaD: Minecraft as a DAW
- Sequencers
- Sends
- Custom samples (todo)

### Recipes
- sequencer: note blocks surrounding a beat
- repeater: note blocks surrounding an enderpearl
- speaker: note blocks surrounding an empty bucket

### BUGS
- stacking beats vertically times out the server, due to handling updates
- recipes not showing up for speaker
- speaker item is huge

### TODO
- use simplified textures for models
- make sends textures directional when placed
- make sends connect mechanically directional
- get speaker working
- show connected paths using particle effects
- spawn particles on beats indicating type of block
- fix recipe deduction glitch
- add delay based on the type of block that is put in the line
- change pitch based on the type of block that is put in the line (up or down)
- right click sequencer to change speed, indicate using color/pitch/something
- create special sequencers that only play on air and only delays through blocks
